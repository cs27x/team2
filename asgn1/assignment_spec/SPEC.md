##Overview

This application will be an open, anonymous Twitter/Yik Yak hybrid for campus-specific professor and class commentary by students. When a user first opens the application, he or she is assigned a unique ID, not for personal use or public identification, but rather for administrative moderation of posts and upvotes/downvotes. 

A post will take the form of a short- to medium-length comment regarding a specific professor, TA, or class. After the post is sent to a central database and disseminated to other phones, it will be displayed in a Reddit/Yik Yak style, and other users may upvote, downvote, or flag inappropriate posts for review.  The app need not completely live, but rather update every hour, half-hour, etc.
